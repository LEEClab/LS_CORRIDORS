# Main LSCorridors code

Here the main pieces of the LSCorridors stable code are located. You may find: 
   1. `LS_corridors_v1_0_1.py`: main script.
   2. `test_LS_corridors.py`: testing script.
   3. `script_calculate_connectivity_index.R`: an R script for calculating the connectivity index of landscapes based on 
   the corridors simulated on them, using LSCorridors.
   4. `gathering_LSCorridors_output.R`: an R script for gathering LSCorridors output in a single data frame 
   (outdated, used in old versions of the package; now all the simulated corridors information is saved in a single file).
